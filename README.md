# Project Description

The Restaurant Data Analysis Project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore restaurant datasets and generate actionable insights. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to identify patterns in customer preferences, restaurant performance, and pricing strategies.
Key questions addressed include:
-Which cuisines are most popular among customers?
-How do ratings vary across locations, cuisines, and cost levels?
-Can we predict restaurant ratings based on cuisine type, cost, and location?
-Which pricing strategies align with higher customer satisfaction?
By combining statistical analysis, visualization, and ML models, the project produces a structured report with insights that can help restaurant owners, food delivery platforms, and analysts make informed business decisions.

# Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy.
- Conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key trends in cuisines, ratings, and costs.
- Applied machine learning techniques to classify restaurants by ratings and predict outcomes.
- Built visualizations and statistical summaries to support decision-making.
- Documented the analysis in a professional PDF report (graphs + conclusions).
